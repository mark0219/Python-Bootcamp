Joe - 

Just wanted to give you a heads-up that former Secretary Rice will be traveling to the UAE and Saudi Arabia 
December 11-14. This is purely a business trip, as you can expect she may conduct courtesy calls with 
government officials. The desk and Posts have been notified as a courtesy. I have direct contact with the RSOs 
as a contingency. Security and Transportation, at their insistence, are being provided by the host countries. 

Hope all is well. 

Best, 

Colby
